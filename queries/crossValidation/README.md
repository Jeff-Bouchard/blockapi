Cross-validation requires API keys from blockchain explorers.
* for Bitcoin, [request an API key](https://api.blockchain.info/customer/signup) from blockchain.com,
and then [activate](https://exchange.blockchain.com/api/#introduction) it.
After doing this, copy `Blockchain` key into `bitcoin\CrossValidationBitcoin.apiKey` attribute.
* for Ethereum, [request an API key](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) from etherScan.io.
Once you have the key, copy `EtherScan` key into `utils\Etherscan.apiKey` attribute.
